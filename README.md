## Two Problems, One Solution

Claude Organize solves two critical problems when working with Claude Code:

### Problem 1: The Messy File Problem üóÇÔ∏è

Claude Code creates files everywhere. Despite CLAUDE.md instructions saying "don't create scripts in the root directory," it keeps creating test files, debug scripts, and documentation right at your project root:

```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-v1.md               # First attempt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-v2.md               # "Fixed" version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-final.md            # "Final" version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-final-FIXED.md      # Actually final?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug-webhook.mjs            # Quick test script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze-performance.mjs      # Debugging session
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (87 more files at root!)
```

**Solution**: Automatic file organization using AI-powered categorization

### Problem 2: The Context Adherence Problem üß†

Claude Code struggles to maintain project context throughout conversations. You have a detailed CLAUDE.md with project rules, but Claude often:

- **Forgets project guidelines** mid-conversation
- **Ignores file organization rules** when creating new files
- **Loses track of coding standards** over time
- **Requires constant reminders** about project conventions

**Example**: You ask "fix the broken tests" and Claude doesn't remember your rule: "NEVER claim success if tests are failing"

**Solution**: The `/enhance` command with two-pass prompt enhancement

#### Before and After

**Before** (what you type):

```
fix the broken tests
```

**After** `/enhance` (what Claude receives):

```
I need help fixing broken tests in this project.

Context:
- Identify which tests are failing and why
- Review test output and error messages
- Fix the underlying issues causing test failures
- Verify all tests pass after fixes

Requirements:
- Run the full test suite first to see current state
- Fix one test at a time, verifying each fix
- Ensure no regression in other tests
- Document any significant changes made

Project-Specific Rules (from CLAUDE.md):
- NEVER claim success if tests are failing
- ALWAYS verify functionality before declaring completion
- Run lint and typecheck after changes

Success Criteria:
- All tests pass
- No linting errors
- Code changes are minimal and focused
```

**üí° Pro Tip**: Use Shift+P (plan mode) with `/enhance` to review the context selection and prompt engineering before execution

## How Claude Organize Helps

### üóÇÔ∏è Automatic File Organization

```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                         # Source code stays untouched
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/                 # Test results organized
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ troubleshooting/         # Debug notes in one place
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ checks/                  # Validation scripts grouped
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ debug/                   # Debug utilities together
```

### üß† Two-Pass Prompt Enhancement

```bash
# Your vague request
/enhance fix the broken tests

# Pass 1: Expands using Claude's prompt best practices
‚úì Transforms 3 words into comprehensive specification
‚úì Adds context, success criteria, and structure

# Pass 2: Integrates relevant CLAUDE.md rules
‚úì Includes: "NEVER claim success if tests are failing"
‚úì Includes: "ALWAYS verify functionality before declaring completion"
‚úì Only adds rules relevant to the task at hand
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g claude-organize
```

### Setup File Organization

You have two options to configure the file organization hook:

#### Option 1: Using Claude's /hooks command (Recommended)

Simply ask Claude to add the hook for you:

```bash
# In Claude Code, just type:
"Add the claude-organize hook using /hooks"

# Claude will use the /hooks command to configure it automatically
```

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "claude-organize" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Use the /enhance Command

The `/enhance` command is automatically installed to `~/.claude/commands/` and ready to use:

```bash
/enhance create a deployment guide
# ‚Üí Comprehensive prompt with relevant CLAUDE.md rules included
```

## Key Features

### File Organization (Hooks)

‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup** - Files move to proper directories instantly  
‚úÖ **AI categorization** - Understands file purpose from content  
‚úÖ **10 script subcategories** - Detailed organization for scripts  
‚úÖ **Safe defaults** - Protects README, LICENSE, configs  
‚úÖ **Context reduction** - Cleaner workspace = better Claude performance

### Prompt Enhancement (/enhance)

‚úÖ **Two-pass enhancement** - First expands using Claude's best practices, then adds CLAUDE.md rules  
‚úÖ **Prompt engineering** - Transforms vague requests into comprehensive specifications  
‚úÖ **Context engineering** - Selects only relevant project rules  
‚úÖ **CLAUDE.md integration** - Automatically includes applicable guidelines  
‚úÖ **Smart detection** - Understands task type from your request  
‚úÖ **Efficient prompts** - No rule dumping, only what's needed  
‚úÖ **Works in plan mode** - Compatible with Claude's planning features

## Architecture

### How It All Works

**File Organization**: User ‚Üí Claude Code ‚Üí Hook ‚Üí claude-organize ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Organized Files

### The /enhance Command Flow

**Prompt Enhancement**: User ‚Üí /enhance ‚Üí Reads CLAUDE.md ‚Üí Context Analysis ‚Üí Enhanced Prompt

### Hooks vs Slash Commands

![Hooks vs Commands](docs/architecture/hooks-vs-commands.png)

- **Hooks**: Automatic, background file organization
- **Slash Commands**: Interactive, user-initiated enhancements

## Common Scenarios

### The "Create and Run" Learning Curve

You might encounter this scenario:

```
Claude: "I'll create test-email.mjs and run it"
*Creates file*
*File gets organized to scripts/testing/*
Claude: "Error: Cannot find module './test-email.mjs'"
```

**This is intentional!** The friction teaches Claude (and us) better habits:

1. **First time**: Claude learns files don't stay at root
2. **Second time**: Claude checks where files went (`find . -name "test-email.mjs"`)
3. **Third time**: Claude runs directly from organized location

Just like training a junior developer: "Test files go in the test directory."

**Pro tip**: Use `/enhance` to help Claude understand the project structure:

```bash
/enhance create and test email functionality
# The enhanced prompt will remind Claude about automatic organization
```

### Why This Matters

The housekeeper doesn't compromise on cleanliness. This "friction" is actually a feature:

- Claude learns project structure through experience
- Better long-term habits > short-term convenience
- Consistent organization > temporary files at root

## Other Slash Commands

- `/claude-organize-bypass` - Toggle file organization on/off
- `/claude-organize-add <pattern>` - Add patterns to be organized
- `/claude-organize-js` - Enable JavaScript organization (experimental)

## Safety & Disclaimers

**‚ö†Ô∏è USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Organize moves files in your project. Always use version control and test in a safe environment first.

- ‚úÖ **Use version control** (Git) before enabling
- ‚úÖ **Test in a safe environment** first
- ‚úÖ **Review the organization log** at `docs/organization-log.json`
