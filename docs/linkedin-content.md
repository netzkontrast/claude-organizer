Every AI team has the same file: fix-approval-workflow-48.mjs

You know the one. Version 48 because Claude Code created 47 duplicates instead of finding the original.

Claude Code is a brilliant teenager.
CLAUDE.md is the "CLEAN YOUR ROOM" poster on the wall.
Both exist. Neither connects.

Watch the evolution of desperation:
Version 1: Please organize files by purpose
Version 2: IMPORTANT: Check existing files first
Version 3: CRITICAL: Follow directory structure
Version 4: Twenty-line organization guide
Version 5: ASCII diagrams of folders

More caps. More emojis. More detail.
Claude Code still drops test-final-v3.js in root.

We keep writing better instructions for a teenager who doesn't read instructions.

Built two fixes that accept reality:

Auto-organization hook: The invisible housekeeper. Every file Claude drops gets placed correctly. Automatically.

/enhance command: Turns grunts into specifications. Fix auth becomes comprehensive requirements. Three words. Full clarity.

No more nagging.
No more manual cleanup.
No more prompt marathons.

The competitive advantage isn't better AI.
It's accepting what AI is.

Stop parenting. Start automating.
Your fix-approval-workflow-49.mjs can wait.

## Article Version

Every AI team has fix-approval-workflow-48.mjs

Forty-eight versions because Claude Code couldn't find the first forty-seven.

We keep writing better instructions for a teenager who doesn't read instructions.

Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md. Acknowledges the rules. Creates test-v12.js in root anyway.

Like a teenager with a "CLEAN YOUR ROOM" poster. The poster exists. The socks still hit the floor.

GitHub documents the pattern:

- Issue #1342: Creates duplicate files
- Issue #2901: Ignores CLAUDE.md instructions
- Issue #3146: Directory management friction

Teams respond predictably. They enhance CLAUDE.md. More rules. More warnings. More ASCII diagrams. Each version more desperate than the last.

> The poster's right there on the wall.

Two problems compound the mess.

First: Organization blindness. Every misplaced file pollutes context. Hour 1: Fast responses. Hour 8: "Why is it suggesting code we already have?" Context pollution isn't just messy. It's expensive.

Second: Communication tax. "Fix auth" needs fifty words of context. Type less, get garbage. Type more, lose flow. Voice tools can't handle technical specs.

> We keep writing better instructions for a teenager who doesn't read instructions.

Built two solutions that accept teenage nature.

**Auto-organization hook: The housekeeper.**
Claude drops files anywhere. Hook picks them up. Places them correctly. Silent. Automatic. Invisible.

**/enhance command: The translator.**
"Fix auth" becomes structured specification. Three words expand to comprehensive requirements. No typing marathons.

> Three words. Full documentation. No typing marathons.

Watch the transformation:

- "Fix auth" → 2-page authentication requirements
- "Debug webhooks" → Complete troubleshooting guide
- "API docs" → Comprehensive endpoint documentation

All following Claude's own best practices. All automatically organized.

The compound effect: Clear requirements produce better code. Better code needs less debugging. Less debugging means fewer duplicate files. Fewer files mean cleaner context. Cleaner context maintains velocity.

> We turned Claude's strength (comprehensive writing) against its weakness (file chaos).

Together they compound: Clear specs. Focused output. Automatic organization. Clean context. Sustained velocity.

The difference isn't better instructions. It's infrastructure that accepts reality.

Your AI architects stopped writing posters. They started building housekeepers.

Implementation: Five minutes. Install from npm. Add the hook. Done.

This is open source because everyone has the same teenager. Same desperate CLAUDE.md evolution. Same fix-approval-workflow-48.mjs.

When we share housekeeping patterns, everyone benefits. When we enhance communication, everyone's grunts get clearer.

> The future isn't changing AI behavior. It's building elegant systems around unchangeable behavior.

Stop trying to fix your teenager. Hire help instead.
